I also work with navigation systems such as radar, and other systems that like GPS to help the crew navigate the aircraft. I make sure that all systems are operating properly for the air crew to use on missions. A typical day would be that I come in to work and get turnover from the previous shift. So our shift is able to know what the previous shift had done, to help make things run more efficiently. that way we don't repeat the same troubleshooting steps they've already done, or swap out the same parts. After we receive turnover we head to roll call where they take accountability for all the shops, they also tell us the priorities for that day. Priorities for the day would be like \"we're launching aircraft xxx, and need launch support for this aircraft\" or \"work this issue on this aircraft\". After we receive our priorities for the day we then walk over to CTK, which is where we check out tools. We check out tools and load them on to the truck, and then we ride on the truck on the flight line. If we're launching an aircraft we would stay in the truck, for the possibility that the air crew has an issue with one of our systems and needs support. If the air crew has an issue the crew chief would call us over on the radio. The truck would pull up to jet while its running up, and the maintainer would go up the ladder or into the aircraft. The maintainer would then talk to the aircrew to troubleshoot the issue. The maintainer would then troubleshoot the issue and see if its possible to fix the issue in a timely manner, so the crew can complete their mission. After the maintainer gets off the and the aircraft launches. They would then work other priorities\u00a0 such as other issues on other jets. Later when the jet lands, the maintainers would debrief the crew. This means that they'll ask the air crew if they had any issues with their systems. If they had issues the maintainer would then ask follow up questions to help with troubleshooting the issue with the jet. for example if one member in the crew says they couldn't hear anything in their headset. You'd then ask if anyone else had this issue. the purpose for this is to help isolate the issue and help with troubleshooting purposes. After debrief is done and the shift is coming to an end, all the shops would start turning in their tools to CTK. Once the tools are turned in I'd head inside to give the next shift turnover, so they\u2019re aware of what we did in shift. That's a typical day in my career field.",
